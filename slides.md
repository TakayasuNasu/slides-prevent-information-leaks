# How to prevent personal information leaks

---

Today we use a variety of web services and mobile applications.

How many hours a day do you spend using web services?

These services have made wealthy our lives.

However, if we use them incorrectly, our personal information may be leaked.

Let's think about how to prevent this from happening.


---

# Main reason of personal information leaks.

- Lost or misplaced laptops and smartphones.
- Mishandling.
- Hacking.

---

# How to prevent.

## Do not enter personal information on websites that you cannot be sure are secure.

There are many fake websites on the Internet that pretend as e-commerce sites, financial institutions, and social networking sites.

We need to make sure there is a key symbol in the URL bar.

---

## Avoid personal use of file-sharing software.

It is risky to exchange files with an unspecified number of people.

For business use, please use the paid service.

---

## If "two-factor authentication" (2FA) is offered, use it whenever possible.

Two-factor authentication is a method of authentication that uses two or more factors when logging into an online service: a knowledge factor such as ID/password or secret question, a possession factor such as SMS authentication or ICE card, and a biometric factor such as face or fingerprint.
